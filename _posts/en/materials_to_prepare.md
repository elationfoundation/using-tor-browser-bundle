Materials to Prepare:
=====================

-   Projector

-   Laptop to visualize demos

-   Tor Browser Bundle, installed on the trainer's device

-   A copy of the Tor Browser Bundle "installer" (a self-extracting archive) for distribution to participants. The Tor Browser Bundle is quite large, so it's a good idea to prepare this ahead of time,  especially if you have a slow Internet connection in the training room.
